## **_About Me_** 

Hi, my name is Christy Li. I am currently a Junior attending high school at High School of Telecommunication for Arts and Science. I also participated in the Software Engineering program that my school offers, which is a great opportunity. This class have given me many memorable experiences. For example, the most recent internship that I got offered was by the SEP Pathfinders Program. I got to work at Animoto. This company gave me a very fascinating experience and I was impressed by how their work space is organized. My first Internship was working at Hunter College, which is also provided by the Pathfinders. Thus, I would like to continue to interact and experience new things in the real world. Last year when I participated in this program I had a lot of fun.
